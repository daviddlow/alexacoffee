        "what (do I put/goes/lives/can I put/) (in/into) the {colour} (bin/box/bucket)",
        "(whats/what is) (the/a) {colour} (bin/box/bucket) for",
        "how (do/can) (we/I) (use/utilise/make use of/fill up) the {colour} (bin/box/bucket)",

Remember to remove the last trailing comma (in the last auto-generated utterance).

These utterances are then passed into the Code Editor of the Skill Builder interface.  The InteractionModel.json contained with this source code package shows an example of how the expanded utterances should be integrated (from line 18 onwards).
